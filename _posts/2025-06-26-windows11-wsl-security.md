When starting the Ubuntu terminal it shows blank, no cursor.

Update 6/30/2025 the command line terminals now show the Ubuntu prompt.  Note that Microsoft did do a update on 6/27/2025 (Friday), so not sure if the update on 6/25/2025 caused the problem and Windows was not display a error (See Appendix).

## Analysis

All command line windows (Wsl-2, Cmd, Powershell) did not have a cursor, but if I opened them with "Run as Administrator" the cursor showed.

### Appendix

Now Ubuntu shows text in command line without having to start as Admin.
