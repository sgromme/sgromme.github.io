# Introduction

Constraint Programming (CP) is a method in computer science and operations research for solving combinatorial problems by stating constraints that must be satisfied rather than describing a step-by-step procedure.


In Open Supply Planning constraints will be associated with each individual facility or node.  Each node is containerized (Kubernetes) , is separated from other nodes and has constraints that control its behavior.  Communication between nodes will be with Apache Kafka messages.
