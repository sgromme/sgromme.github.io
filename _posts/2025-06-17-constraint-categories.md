Question: What are supply planning constraints?

Response:
'''
Supply planning constraints are the real-world limitations and business rules that must be respected when creating feasible and optimized supply plans. These constraints ensure that the resulting plan is practical, executable, and aligned with company goals.

ðŸ“¦ Common Categories of Supply Planning Constraints:
1. Capacity Constraints
Production capacity: Max output per time period per resource.

Storage capacity: Limits on inventory at warehouses or distribution centers.

Transportation capacity: Limits on truck/container availability or shipping volume.

2. Material Constraints
Availability of components or raw materials.

Lead times for procurement and delivery.

3. Inventory Constraints
Minimum/maximum inventory levels.

Safety stock requirements.

Shelf-life or expiry dates (for perishables).

4. Demand Fulfillment Constraints
Customer service levels (fill rate, OTIF).

Order prioritization or allocation rules.

5. Scheduling Constraints
Setup/changeover times and costs.

Shift patterns, working hours, or maintenance windows.

6. Financial Constraints
Budget limits for production, procurement, or logistics.

Cost minimization or profit maximization objectives.

7. Policy Constraints
Make-to-order vs. make-to-stock policies.

Fixed production lot sizes.

Supplier contracts (e.g., MOQ, quotas).
