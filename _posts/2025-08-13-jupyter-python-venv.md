# Problem

The Jupyter Notebooks freezes when run in Visual Studio Code.  It runs when run from the local Jupyter web page.

System:
1. Ubuntu
2. Python3 venv
3. Visual Studion Code
4. 'jupyter' was install with pip in the Python virtual ( module venv)

# Analysis

Juypter Notebook install seems to need Conda to be installed.  After deleting the environment and reinstall 'ipykernel' the VSC notebook will run.  It still wants 'Conda' but does run.


# Solution

1. Delete the Python environment
2. Install with Pip 'ipykernel' instead of 'juypter'

Juypter Notebooks is still looling for 'Conda' but it at least runs in VSC.
